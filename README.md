# Amazon Customer Churn Prediction Challenge

## Background

Customer churn refers to the loss of customers for any reason. When business lose customers, they will lose some sources of revenue, and to mitigate that loss, they have to invest extra resources coming up with solutions to attract more customers. Hence, it is essential for business to understand customer churn and deal with it at the very beginning.

Machine learning models is a tool for business to explain customer's churning behavior. They could predict whether a customer is about to stop their subscription and further explain what factors lead to the decision given the available data. With these insights, business can improve their services and marketing strategies accordingly and thus retain their customers.

In this project, we assume the role of a marketing analyst in the marketing department of a mobile phone operator. Given the service usage and other customer behavior data, we aim to identify customers potentially at risk of churning and explain why they would leave.
